Subject: northern natural gas yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses . the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts . we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services . ken dear ets c

Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18 vance : per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal , depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not . producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level . once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets . non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result in a financial loss ) . in either case , the

Subject: spinaker / n . padre island block 883 : allocations per our various discussions , i am sending an email to reiterate the disposition of volumes at meter 9862 , the lehman spinaker pay meter . at this time , the general land office is transporting their share of production ( 21 . 8945 % interest ) and hpl is purchasing the remaining 78 . 1055 % . the glo has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848 , effective september 1 , 2000 . during this time , some test gas flowed . i have had the hpl purchase back - dated to coincide with the transport nomination , and have had both deals moved to 9862 . the meter should probably be designated a callout / swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after the production month by volume management . for october production forward , i am going to re - rank / confirm the pay meter to ensure that the glo receives a volume which should be close to their percentage after actuals close for the month . this should alleviate any large balance swings

Subject: marketing services / scheduling daren , thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a strong case could be made in favor of that idea . it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing , nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge base and the responsibility factor . it is a " who ' s on first " issue . if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services immensely . as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture . i b

Subject: re : big cowboy for august mary : is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where 985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume , and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350 mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of " nothing " being confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000 this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the volume

Subject: cilco pathing - withdrawl and hplc transport pathing hey guys , just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue . while i agree that howard , robert and george needed to work on this together , i do not think that howard should have been the driving force behind this . once we left the meeting , they all convened on the 37 th floor and worked from howard ' s desk - with howard sitting down doing much of the work . i also think that the below e - mail should not have come from howard , but should have originated out of the logistics group . i understand that howard has prior scheduling experience , but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially took on that role in getting this set up correctly . he too had to sit down and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly ( ? ) . in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up , but i am concerned at the role that he played . team effort is important and it ' s what we all want between our groups

Subject: p & l tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule . the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco and storage .

Subject: pg & e texoma volumes in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma ( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a hit when these actual volumes flow through . i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered . someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible . please give me a call if you have any questions .

Subject: ranks communication after getting your imput , i think this is the best : we will only communicate needs improvement and issues . there will be differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a bonus ( may need to finda another role within or outside enron which is a better fit ) . message to someone new to enron in that category should be different . glad they are here : believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution : doing the right thing to learn business , but that contributions to date are not significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus . let me know what you think . thanks bob
